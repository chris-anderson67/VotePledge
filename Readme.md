###Vote Pledge App experiment
#Chris Anderson
- Users will pledge to vote on election day

#Plan:
- v0.0: users should be able to sign up - and be verified by email
- v0.1: users should be emailed about voting 
- v0.2: users reminded via email about voting

#Possible features: 
- verfiy paypal payment of 10$ which will go through only
        if they do not vote. 

The purpose of this webapp is to mess around with html and python,
and hopefully eventually turn it into something useful.

Initial code examples from a tutorial on code.tutsplus.com
which details and walks through the creating of a bucketlist webserver.
