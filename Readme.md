#Vote Pledge App experiment 0.3.5
###Chris Anderson
- Users pledge to vote in major election - 

## Changes:
- v0.1: users should be able to sign up - and be verified by email
        - no password or login, simply adding their email

- v0.2: users should be emailed on signing up
- v0.3: make the site look good, add some css, fancy stuff, colors, etc
    - 0.3.0: basic bootstrap styles
    - 0.3.1: custom css for login page
    - 0.3.2: format login page as home page with two columns
- v0.3.5: Swith to SQLlite
    - Merge into Heroku
    - Database Functional

## Possible future options:
- Move deployment to DigitalOcean
- Improve email response reliability (authentication to votepledge email still shoddy).

The purpose of this webapp was to mess around with html and python, and
increase voter turnout.

Boiler plate code and Flask know-how from Miguel Grinberg's book,
*Flask Web Development*, which has been a great resource that I 
highly recomend.
